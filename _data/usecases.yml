  description: Vespa is a full-featured text search engine and supports both regular text search
    and fast approximate vector search (ANN). This makes it easy to create high-performing search
    applications at any scale, whether you want to use traditional techniques, or a modern vector based
    approach. You can even combine both approaches efficiently in the same query, something no other engine
    can do.

  description: Recommendation, personalization and targeting involves evaluating recommender
    models over content items to select the best ones. Vespa lets you build applications which does this online,
    typically combining fast vector search and filtering with evaluation of machine-learned models
    over the items. This makes it possible to make recommendations  specifically for each user or situation, using
    completely up to date information.

  description: Providing direct answers to questions is useful when creating chatbots,
    virtual assistants, and to answer some search queries. Modern question answerers
    combine evaluation of transformer based language models with efficient retrieval of candidate text
    snippets. Vespa makes it easy to build question answering systems combining the research
    state of the art with production-ready performance.

  description: Applications such as e-commerce use a combination of
    structured data and text and need to provide structured navigation - grouping data dynamically
    for navigation and filtering - in combination with search and recommendation.
    Vespa provides all the features required for this with great performance, which makes it possible to
    realize functionally complete applications leveraging structured data on a unified architecture.
